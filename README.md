<p> # Multiplayer Networking Quiz Game</p>

<p>This type of application draws inspiration from popular quiz platforms like Kahoot and Quizlet but with a focus on networking concepts.</p>

<p>I've created a fully functional networking quiz app with a clean, responsive design featuring a multiplayer lobby system and interactive quiz gameplay</p>

<p>#For the design:<br>
1. I used a vibrant tech-inspired color scheme with purples and blues that evoke a networking/technology feel.<br>
2. The interface will be clean, responsive, and user-friendly with smooth animations for transitions between quiz states.</p>

<p>#I'll focus on:<br>
1. Creating a welcoming homepage with a clear call-to-action<br>
2. Building a lobby system for creating/joining quiz rooms<br>
3. Implementing the core quiz interface with networking questions<br>
4. Setting up basic navigation between pages<br>
5. Adding responsive design for all screen sizes</p>

<p>#For the styling, I'll use:<br>
1. A primary purple/blue gradient theme<br>
2. Clean, readable typography<br>
3. Card-based components with subtle shadows<br>
4. Interactive elements with hover effects<br>
5. Simple animations for transitions</p>

<p>Since Im building a multiplayer game, If want to save information, add user accounts, and manage game state, I need to a Database to add these features without complex technical setups.</p>
