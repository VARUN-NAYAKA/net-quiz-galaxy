<p> # Multiplayer Networking Quiz Game</p>

<p>This type of application draws inspiration from popular quiz platforms like Kahoot and Quizlet but with a focus on networking concepts.</p>

<p>I've created a fully functional networking quiz app with a clean, responsive design featuring a multiplayer lobby system and interactive quiz gameplay</p>

<p>#For the design:
1. I used a vibrant tech-inspired color scheme with purples and blues that evoke a networking/technology feel.
2. The interface will be clean, responsive, and user-friendly with smooth animations for transitions between quiz states.</p>

<p>#I'll focus on:
1. Creating a welcoming homepage with a clear call-to-action
2. Building a lobby system for creating/joining quiz rooms
3. Implementing the core quiz interface with networking questions
4. Setting up basic navigation between pages
5. Adding responsive design for all screen sizes</p>

<p>#For the styling, I'll use:
1. A primary purple/blue gradient theme
2. Clean, readable typography
3. Card-based components with subtle shadows
4. Interactive elements with hover effects
5. Simple animations for transitions</p>

<p>Since Im building a multiplayer game, If want to save information, add user accounts, and manage game state, I need to a Database to add these features without complex technical setups.</p>

<p>#To run the program:
Clone the repository (replace with your actual Git URL)
git clone <YOUR_PROJECT_GIT_URL>

Navigate to the project directory
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
